## Overview:

This Phase 2 Project can be used as a recommendation for the type of production a new studio should create to achieve maximum profitability.

## Business Problem:

Freelander Innovations is undergoing massive expansion within North America and needs to diversify its portfolio within the entertainment industry, specifically movie production. Freelander Innovations will experience increased profitability by choosing the right variables for a successful film.


## Data:

Freelander Innovations is utilizing two dataframes from IMDB and a Production Budget Dataset. This data was used to gauge profitability by analyzing Genre, Production Budget, Domestic Gross Revenue, and Directors.

## Methods:

A profitability ratio was created by dividing Domestic Gross Revenue by Production Budget to identify the variables necessary for a successful movie, such as Genre, Budget, and Directors.

## Results:

There showed to be a very high correlation between the amount spent on a movie and its Domestic Gross Revenue.

A budget of $10,000,000 signals that only a few genres would be applicable for our choice of a high-quality movie.

As seen, Horror and Thriller have the highest return on investment, signaling that this would be the best genre type for Freelander Innovations.

The top 10 Horror directors with the highest profitability ratio were parsed, and 5 directors were selected as potential candidates to lead our production team.

## Conclusions

The analysis leads to five recommended directors who will lead our project and have shown to 10x the revenue compared to production costs. This signifies that if we are able to onboard one of these directors to lead our team and production, there is a very high likelihood of profitability.
